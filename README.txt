In this repository there are all the scripts used to obtain the results published in Vedrí et al. (2025). In this paper we made a comparison between previous published equations, linear methods and nonlinear methods to find which one is the best to retrieve surface air temperature (SAT) from remote sensing data (MODIS), reanalysis data (ERA5), geographical and topographical data.

Database_creation_scripts contains the scripts used to filter, interpolate, merge and calculate the different variables needed in this paper.
Linear_equations_comparison contains the equation published in Niclòs et al al.(2014) which were the inspiration of this work.
Linear_methods_scripts contains the linear methods used and how they were applied and Nonlinear_methods_scripts contains the nonlinear.
